Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.8.2 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.8 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.8 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows ,  MacOS  and  Ubuntu . For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on Windows /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on MacOS /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on Ubuntu Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort().reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"logistics/","title":"Class logistics","tags":["welcome"],"text":"main a img {\n    width: 5rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n}\n Course logistics Describe here the logistics of your class."},{"url":"search/","title":"Search results","tags":[],"text":"window.init_search(); Search Results \nLoading..."},{"url":"assets/scripts/get_highlights/","title":"get_highlights","tags":[],"text":"if isempty get metadata \"homepage\" , \"highlights\", nothing else highlights htl \"\"\" section div class \"content\" h2 x \"name\" h2 p x \"text\" p div div class \"preview\" img src \" x \"img\" \" div section \"\"\" for x in metadata \"homepage\" \"highlights\" htl \"\"\" div class \"subjectscontainer wide\" h1 Highlights h1 div class \"contain\" highlights div div \"\"\" end"},{"url":"assets/scripts/get_subjects/","title":"get_subjects","tags":[],"text":"let sections metadata \"sidebar\" sections htl \"\"\" let input other page.input output other page.output name get output.frontmatter, \"title\", basename input.relative path desc get output.frontmatter, \"description\", nothing tags get output.frontmatter, \"tags\", String image get output.frontmatter, \"image\", nothing class \"no decoration\", \"tag replace x, \" \" \" \" \" for x in tags ..., image nothing || isempty image ? nothing htl \"\"\" a title desc class class href root url \" \" other page.url h3 name h3 img src image a \"\"\" end for other page in collections section id .pages \"\"\" for section id, section name in sections isempty sections ? nothing htl \"\"\" div class \"wide subjectscontainer\" h1 Subjects h1 div class \"subjects\" sections div div \"\"\" end"},{"url":"ch04_Radiation/ch4_radiation/","title":"ch4_radiation","tags":[],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.32 using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

Two dimensional advection diffusion The two dimensional advection diffusion equation adds advection and diffusion operators acting in a second spatial dimension y that is perpendicular to x . The temperature field T is then a function T T x, y, t , and the PDE becomes \\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial t u x,y \\frac \\partial T \\partial x v x,y \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\kappa \\left \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 \\right , where \\vec u x,y u, v u\\,\\mathbf \\hat x v\\,\\mathbf \\hat y is a velocity vector field, and each partial derivative is also a function of x , y and t . We will think of x as being the longitudinal direction positive from west to east and y as the latitudinal direction positive from south to north . \"\"\" begin reviewBox bind show review CheckBox default false md\"\"\" Review of multivariable calculus identities and notation Check the box for a review reviewBox \"\"\" end if show review md\"\"\" The two dimensional advection diffusion equation is often written more succinctly as \\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial t \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T \\kappa \\nabla^ 2 T, using the following shorthand notation. The gradient operator is defined as \\nabla \\equiv \\left \\frac \\partial \\partial x , \\frac \\partial \\partial y \\right such that \\nabla T \\left \\frac \\partial T \\partial x , \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\right and \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T u, v \\cdot \\left \\frac \\partial T \\partial x , \\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\right u \\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y . The Laplacian operator \\nabla^ 2 , sometimes denoted \\Delta , is defined as \\nabla^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 \\partial y^ 2 such that \\nabla^ 2 T \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 . The divergence operator is defined as \\nabla \\cdot \\quad , such that \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u \\left \\frac \\partial \\partial x , \\frac \\partial \\partial x \\right \\cdot u,v \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y . Note Since seawater is largely incompressible , we have \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y 0 , i.e. ocean currents are approximately a non divergent flow . Among other implications, this allows us to write \\begin align \\vec u \\cdot \\nabla T& u\\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T x,y,t \\partial y \\newline & u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y T\\left \\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\frac \\partial v \\partial y \\right \\newline & \\left u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x T\\frac \\partial u \\partial x \\right \\left v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\frac \\partial v \\partial y \\right \\newline & \\frac \\partial uT \\partial x \\frac \\partial vT \\partial x \\newline & \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u T \\end align using the product rule separately in both x and y . The flux form two dimensional advection diffusion equation This lets us finally re write the two dimensional advection diffusion equation as \\frac \\partial T \\partial t \\nabla \\cdot \\vec u T \\kappa \\nabla^ 2 T, which is the form we will use in our numerical algorithm below. \"\"\" end md\"\"\" Numerical solution of the 2D equation Discretizing advection in two dimensions In Lecture XX we saw that in one dimension we can discretize a first partial derivative in space using the centered finite difference \\frac \\partial T x i , t n \\partial x \\approx \\frac T i 1 ^ n T i 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta x . In two dimensions, we discretize the partial derivative the exact same way, except that we also need to keep track of the cell index j in the y dimension \\frac \\partial T x i , y j , t n \\partial x \\approx \\frac T i 1,\\, j ^ n T i 1,\\,j ^ n 2 \\Delta x . The x gradient kernel below, implemented using the `OffsetArray` type, is shown below, and is reminiscent of the edge detection or sharpening kernels used in image processing and machine learning \"\"\" md\"\"\" The first order partial derivative in y is similarly discretized as \\frac \\partial T x i , y j , t n \\partial y \\approx \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y . Its kernel is shown below. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now that we have discretized the two derivate terms, we can write out the advective tendency for computing T i, j, n 1 as u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\approx u i,\\, j ^ n \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y v i,\\, j ^ n \\frac T i,\\, j 1 ^ n T i,\\,j 1 ^ n 2 \\Delta y . We implement this in julia as a series of methods for the `advect` function. The first method computes the advective tendency as a single `Float64` type for the i,j grid cell while the second method returns an array of the tendencies for each grid cell using two nested for loops. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discretizing diffusion in two dimensions Just as with advection, the process for discretizing the diffusion operators effectively consists of repeating the one dimensional process for x in a second dimension y , separately \\kappa \\left \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial x^ 2 \\frac \\partial^ 2 T \\partial y^ 2 \\right \\kappa \\left \\frac T i 1,\\ j ^ n 2T i,\\ j ^ n T i 1,\\ j ^ n \\left \\Delta x \\right ^ 2 \\frac T i,\\ j 1 ^ n 2T i,\\ j ^ n T i,\\ j 1 ^ n \\left \\Delta y \\right ^ 2 \\right The corresponding x and y second derivative kernels are shown below \"\"\" md\"\"\" Just as we did with advection, we implement a `diffuse` function using multiple dispatch \"\"\" md\"\"\" No flux boundary conditions We want to impose the no flux boundary conditions, which states that u\\frac \\partial T \\partial x \\kappa \\frac \\partial T \\partial x 0 at x boundaries and v\\frac \\partial T \\partial y \\kappa \\frac \\partial T \\partial y 0 at the y boundaries. To impose this, we treat i 1 and i N x as ghost cells , which do not do anything expect help us impose these boundaries conditions. Discretely, the boundary fluxes between i 1 and i 2 vanish if \\dfrac T 2,\\,j ^ n T 1,\\,j ^ n \\Delta x 0 or T 1,\\,j ^ n T 2,\\,j ^ n . Thus, we can implement the boundary conditions by updating the temperature of the ghost cells to match their interior point neighbors \"\"\" function update ghostcells A Array Float64,2 option \"no flux\" Atmp view A , if option \"no flux\" A 1, Atmp 2, Atmp end, Atmp end 1, A , 1 Atmp , 2 Atmp , end Atmp , end 1 end end md\"Let's get a feel for what this is actually doing\" begin A rand Float64, 6,6 heatmap A, size 200, 200 end | as svg begin Acopy copy A update ghostcells Acopy heatmap Acopy, size 200, 200 end | as svg md\"\"\" Timestepping \"\"\" md\"\"\" Data structures \"\"\" begin struct Grid N Int64 L Float64 Δx Float64 Δy Float64 x Array Float64,2 y Array Float64,2 Nx Int64 Ny Int64 function Grid N, L Δx L N m Δy L N m x 0.

But the Earth does not have a single, uniform temperature rather, at a particular moment in time, different places on Earth are at different temperatures, and those different temperatures change over time due to several mechanisms. In this notebook we will look at two fundamental mechanisms advection and diffusion . Let's think about the temperature in the ocean. Since the ocean is a fluid that is in motion, a warm \"parcel\" of water can flow move to a new location due to the physical motion of the water itself this is advection . And even if the water doesn't move, temperature or a higher concentration of some substance dissolved in the fluid can spread out due to molecular mechanisms this is diffusion . \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this notebook we will restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension 1D . So we will think about the temperature T , for example, being a function T t, x of two independent variables time, t space, x We want to calculate a value of the temperature T for each possible pair of values t, x , i.e. for all time 0 and all positions. The temperature at a given point will change due to different physical processes. We need to model this by writing down equations describing each physical process and how it affects the temperature. Since there are now two independent variables, t and x , we can expect to end up with derivatives with respect to both of these variables, so that the rate of change of temperature in time at a given point depends also on gradients of the temperature in space . This will lead to a partial differential equation that relates partial derivatives of T . In the context of climate modelling, we can think of x as being the latitude , supposing that the temperature is the same at all points with the same latitude. In this way we could model the fact that the poles are cold and the equator is warm, and we could model how heat flows from hot to cold. However, we clearly cannot model actual ocean currents like this, which would require two, or even three, spatial dimensions. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Visualising advection diffusion \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here is a visualisation of the physical processes of advection and diffusion in one dimension that we will discuss and build during this notebook. \"\"\" md\"\"\" U bind UU Slider 1 0.01 1, show value true, default 0 D bind DD Slider 0.2 0.001 0.2, show value true, default 0 \"\"\" md\"\"\" Temperature profiles and discretization \"\"\" md\"\"\" An ordinary differential equation needs an initial value for each variable. Similarly, we will need an initial function T 0 x that gives us the temperature at each position x . Let's suppose that the position is restricted to the interval 0, L x . As usual, to represent the continuous function T 0 x on a computer, we will need to discretise it in some way, i.e. approximate the continuous function by a finite set of numbers in the computer. The simplest but far from the only discretisation method is to sample the function at discrete grid points or nodes x i , for i 1, \\dots, N x . For simplicity we will take these equally spaced, with spacing x i 1 x i \\delta x L x N x . \"\"\" md\"\"\" For example, let's consider the following initial temperature profile \"\"\" T₀ x sin 2π x ^2 0.5 T₀ x sin 2π x 2 cos 4π x 0.2 md\"\"\" and define the grid points as follows \"\"\" begin Nₓ 20 Lₓ 1.0 δx Lₓ Nₓ xs δx 2 δx Lₓ end xs md\"\"\" It turns out to be a good idea to take the grid points at the centre of each interval, so that we have N x intervals and N x grid points, starting at x 1 \\delta x 2 and finishing at x N L x \\delta x 2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We call such a function of x at a given time a temperature profile . Let's draw it both as a function and as a heatmap \"\"\" md\"\"\" We will denote by T^0 i the initial temperature at grid point number i . \"\"\" md\"\"\" A useful way to think about T^n i is as some kind of spatial average of T t n, x over the interval of positions between neighbouring grid points, so T i is the average over the interval between x i \\frac \\delta x 2 and x i \\frac \\delta x 2 . We can thus think of the following piecewise constant approximation to the original continuous function \"\"\" let δx xs 2 xs 1 p plot 0 0.001 Lₓ, T₀, label \"T₀\", lw 1, ls dash scatter xs, T₀. xs , label \"sampled\" scatter xs, zero. xs , label \"x nodes\", alpha 0.5, ms 3, lw 2 for i in 1 length xs plot xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , c green, lw 4, lab false plot xs i δx 2, 0 , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, T₀ xs i , xs i δx 2, 0 , c green, lw 1, lab false, ls dash, alpha 0.3 end xlabel \"x\" ylabel \"T₀ x \" end md\"\"\" Advection \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's think of this profile as representing the temperature in each small volume, or \"parcel\", of fluid. Let's suppose that the fluid is moving to the right with a constant, uniform speed U . Uniform here means that the speed is the same in all parts of the fluid. Then the temperature profile should also move with the fluid We call a quantity, such as the temperature, that is carried along with the fluid a tracer . If we fix our attention at a single, fixed point in space, say the grid point x i , the temperature there will vary over time, due to the fact that the fluid is moving past it. How it varies in time depends on the values at neighbouring grid points, since they determine how much heat will be transported into and out of the current cell. The point of view where we fix our attention at one point in space is called Eulerian . The alternative is to follow a parcel of fluid as it moves along in space this is called Lagrangian . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Visualising fluxes in a fluid \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's visualise what happens as the fluid moves past a grid point, or rather the cell centered at a grid point. We will visualise tracer particles moving inside the fluid \"\"\" N 5000 begin xx abs. 2 . 4 . rand N .^ 2 . 1.5 yy rand N end δ 0.8 md\"\"\" show particles entering and leaving in \\delta t bind show particles CheckBox \"\"\" md\"\"\" t bind t Slider 0 0.001 2, show value true, default 0 \"\"\" md\"\"\" Time stepping \"\"\" md\"\"\" We want to model how the temperature profile changes in time due to the flow of the fluid. We'll do so by looking at each cell and asking how much heat enters and leaves the cell in a given time step, of duration \\delta t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call T^n i the approximate unknown average value of T in the cell at position x i and at the n th time step t n , i.e. an approximation of T t n, x i , where t n n \\, \\delta t . Then T^ n 1 i \\simeq T t n \\delta t, x i and T^ n i 1 \\simeq T t n, x i \\delta x . Note that the superscript n in these algorithms does not mean a power it's just a label for the time step. We could write T i^ n instead, but that is annoying to both write and read, so we omit the parentheses. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose the fluid is moving to the right with speed U . During a time step of duration \\delta t , the temperature T^n i at cell i changes for two reasons some heat enters cell i some heat leaves cell i Note that most of the fluid that starts within cell i remains within that cell during the time step if the time step is short enough , as we see from the visualisation above. To calculate how much heat enters and leaves, note that only heat in the region of fluid within a distance U \\, \\delta t from the boundary of the cell will cross into that cell. So a proportion U \\, \\delta t \\delta x of the amount in cell i crosses the boundary. We will blur the distinction between \"amount of heat\" and temperature. Hence, roughly an amount T^n i U \\delta t \\delta x will leave cell number i and cross into cell i 1 the cell to the right . Similarly, an amount T^n i 1 U \\delta t \\delta x will enter cell i from the neighbouring cell i 1 on the left. Hence we arrive at the following T^ n 1 i T^ n i T^n i 1 T^n i \\, U \\, \\delta t \\delta x. Note that on the right hand side we have quantities at the time step n , and on the left at time step n 1 . So this tells us how to update our quantities from slice n to slice n 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous limit Advection equation PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Rearranging the previous equation we get \\frac T^ n 1 i T^ n i \\delta t \\frac T^n i 1 T^n i \\delta x \\, U. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Taking the continuum limit when \\delta t \\to 0 and \\delta x \\to 0 , we recognise the definition of partial derivatives with respect to time and space variables from multivariable calculus. Note the different indices that change on the two sides of the equation. Denoting these partial derivatives using \\partial , we arrive at the advection equation \\frac \\partial T t, x \\partial t U \\frac \\partial T t, x \\partial x , or for short \\frac \\partial T \\partial t U \\frac \\partial T \\partial x . Since T is a function of both x and t , and this equation involves partial derivatives with respect to both of the independent variables, this is a partial differential equation PDE . It describes how the function T t, x changes continuously as a function both of time and space. Although there are some analytical methods to solve PDEs, often it's necessary to use numerical methods. Here we'll look at simple numerical methods to solve such equations. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Numerics for the advection equation \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's return to the version of the equation in which the value at the following time step is isolated T^ n 1 i T^ n i \\left U \\frac \\delta t \\delta x \\right T^n i T^n i 1 . In the last term on the right hand side, we see that we require combinations of values of T at the same time step from different places, with certain coefficients. \"\"\" md\"\"\" There are many approaches to implementing this numerically. The simplest is to directly transcribe the equation for the i th entry of the vector. Calling `T` the current vector, i.e. \\mathbf T ^n T^n i i 1, \\ldots, N x , and `T′` the new vector at the next time step, we have the following basic expression T′ i T i δt U T i 1 T i δx But now we realise a problem What should we do when i 1 ? This will try to access the index 0 of the vector `T`, which does not exist \"\"\" md\"\"\" Boundary conditions This illustrates the necessity of choosing boundary conditions that specify what happens at the edge of the domain. For simplicity we will choose to use periodic boundary conditions . This is a convenient mathematical fiction that allows us to treat all cells as being on the same footing, by wrapping the system around a torus, so that cells i 1 and i N x are neighbours. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can then write this as follows, where we separate out the case i 1 \"\"\" function advection T, δt, δx, U N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length bulk cells for i in 2 N T′ i T i δt U T i T i 1 δx end boundary cells T′ 1 T 1 δt U T 1 T N δx periodic return T′ end md\"\"\" This performs a single time step of the advection equation it takes in the current vector of T s and returns the new T s after the step. Note that this is just like a step of the Euler method for solving ODEs, but where many spatial coordinates are updated at the same time. Effectively we are solving a system of coupled ODEs \"\"\" δt 0.001 U 0.2 assign colours to particles cs map xx do x if U δ x 0 1 elseif 1 U δ x 1 2 else 0 end end begin plot 0, 1, 1, 0, 0 , 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 , series shape, alpha 0.5, fill true, ratio 1, label false, leg false new xx xx .

This is due to the way we are approximating. A better way to discretize the spatial derivative is using the following centered difference \\frac \\partial T t n, x i \\partial x \\simeq \\frac T^n i 1 T^n i 1 2 \\delta x \"\"\" function advection2 T, δt, δx, U N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length for i in 2 N 1 T′ i T i δt U T i 1 T i 1 2δx end periodic boundary T′ 1 T 1 δt U T 2 T N 2δx T′ N T N δt U T 1 T N 1 2δx return T′ end md\"\"\" Diffusion \"\"\" md\"\"\" Another key physical process is diffusion . This models how temperature or mass spreads out from hot or high concentration regions towards regions where it is cold or where there is a low concentration. Physical mechanism Random walks The physical mechanism behind this is random motion this is the continuous limit of equations describing the evolution of the probability distribution in space and time of a cloud of random walkers. This is the same process that we studied in lecture 2.6. Using our current notation, there we showed that the probability distribution of a cloud of random walkers satisfies the following time evolution p^ n 1 i \\frac 1 2 p^n i 1 p^n i 1 If now we say that the walkers jump only with a certain probability, with a large probability to stay in the same place, and that these random walkers are the carriers of heat, then we get T^ n 1 i \\kappa T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 . Watch this video https www.youtube.com watch?v a3V0BJLIo c from last semester's class to see Grant Sanderson explaining this. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous limit Heat equation PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Introducing \\delta x as the spatial discretisation, and \\delta t as the time step, we get T^ n 1 i \\kappa \\frac \\delta t \\delta x^2 T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" The continuous limit is the following heat equation or diffusion equation \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac \\partial T \\partial t \\kappa \\frac \\partial^2 T \\partial x^2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Here, \\kappa is the heat diffusivity , which says how quickly heat spreads out. In the context of diffusion of mass the equivalent is the diffusion coefficient , D . \"\"\" md\"\"\" To obtain a numerical method to solve this equation, we again need to discretise this, in particular the second derivative. One possible discretisation is \\frac \\partial^2 T \\partial x^2 t n, x i \\simeq \\frac T^n i 1 2 T^n i T^n i 1 \\delta x^2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" This may again be transcribed directly into code \"\"\" function diffusion T, δt, δx, D N length T T′ similar T create new vector of the same length for i in 2 N 1 T′ i T i δt D T i 1 2T i T i 1 δx^2 end periodic boundary T′ 1 T 1 δt D T 2 2T 1 T N δx^2 T′ N T N δt D T 1 2T N T N 1 δx^2 return T′ end bind n4 Slider 1 length evolution4 , show value true md\"\"\" The advection diffusion PDE \"\"\" md\"\"\" Finally we can combine both mechanisms, to describe a tracer that is both being advected at a constant speed and diffusing.

In the case of large variations, however, this approximation is not very reliable. While oceans are dark and absorbant, α ocean \\approx 0.05 , ice and snow are bright and reflective \\alpha ice,\\,snow \\approx 0.5 to 0.9 . Thus, if much of the ocean's surface freezes over, we expect Earth's albedo to rise dramatically, causing more sunlight to be reflected to space, which in turn causes even more cooling and more of the ocean to freeze, etc. This non linear positive feedback effect is referred to as the ice albedo feedback see illustration below . \"\"\" function α T α0 Model.α, αi 0.5, ΔT 10. if T ΔT return αi elseif ΔT T ΔT return αi α0 αi T ΔT 2ΔT elseif T ΔT return α0 end end begin T example 20. 1. 20. plot size 600, 400 , ylims 0.2, 0.6 plot 20, 10 , 0.2, 0.2 , fillrange 0.6, 0.6 , color lightblue, alpha 0.2, label nothing plot 10, 20 , 0.2, 0.2 , fillrange 0.6, 0.6 , color red, alpha 0.12, label nothing plot T example, α.

The preindustrial combination of natural greenhouse effect and incoming solar radiation yielded temperatures between the freezing and boiling points of water across most of the planet, allowing ecoystems based on liquid water to thrive. The climate system, however, is rife with non linear effects like the ice albedo effect , which reveal just how fragile our habitable planet is and just how unique our stable pre industrial climate was. We learned in Lecture 20 that in response to temperature fluctuations, net negative feedbacks act to restore Earth's temperature back towards a single equilibrium state in which absorbed solar radiation is balanced by outgoing thermal radiation. Here, we explore how non linear positive feedbacks can temporarily result in a net positive feedback and modify Earth's state space. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 2.1 Exploring the non linear ice albedo feedback In Lecture 20 Part II https www.youtube.com watch?v D3jpfeQCISU , we learned how introducing non linear terms in ordinary differential equations can lead to complex state spaces that allow for multiple fixed points e.g. for \\dot x \\mu x^ 2 . Let's explore how this plays out with the non linear ice albedo feedback by varying the initial condition T 0 \\equiv T t 0 and allowing the system to evolve for 200 years. \"\"\" begin T0 slider bind T0 interact Slider 60. 0.0025 30., default 24., show value true md\"\"\" T₀ T0 slider °C\"\"\" end begin ebm interact Model.EBM Float64 T0 interact , 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm interact, 200 end md\"We can get an overview of the behavior by drawing a set of these curves all on the same graph \" begin p equil plot xlabel \"year\", ylabel \"temperature °C \", legend bottomright, xlims 0, 205 , ylims 60, 30. plot 0, 200 , 60, 60 , fillrange 10., 10. , fillalpha 0.3, c lightblue, label nothing annotate 120, 20, text \"completely frozen\", 10, darkblue plot 0, 200 , 10, 10 , fillrange 30., 30. , fillalpha 0.09, c red, lw 0., label nothing annotate 120, 25, text \"no ice\", 10, darkred for T0 sample in 60. 5. 30. ebm Model.EBM T0 sample, 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm, 200 plot p equil, ebm.t, ebm.T, label nothing end T un 7.5472 for δT in 1.e 2 2, 1., 0., 1., 2. ebm un Model.EBM T un δT, 0., 1., Model.CO2 const Model.run ebm un, 200 plot p equil, ebm un.t, ebm un.T, label nothing, linestyle dash end plot p equil, 200 , Model.T0 , markershape circle, label \"Our pre industrial climate stable ''warm'' branch \", color orange, markersize 8 plot p equil, 200 , 38.3 , markershape circle, label \"Alternate universe pre industrial climate stable ''cold'' branch \", color aqua, markersize 8 plot p equil, 200 , T un , markershape diamond, label \"Impossible alternate climate unstable branch \", color lightgrey, markersize 8, markerstrokecolor white, alpha 1. p equil end md\"We see that for T₀ ⪆ round T un, digits 2 °C, all of the curves seem to converge on the T 14°C equilibrium or fixed point that we saw in Lecture 20. Curves that start below this value warm up and while curves that start above this value will cool down. For T₀ ⪅ round T un, digits 2 °C, however, the temperatures converge on a much colder equilibrium around T 40°C. This is the Snowball Earth equilibrium. These two states are referred to as stable equilibria because even if the state gets temporarily pushed slightly away from its equilibrium, it will eventually converge right back to its equilibrium. So what happens is T₀ ≈ round T un, digits 2 °C? For some exact temperature near there, there is indeed an equilibrim state if you start with that temperature you will stay there forever. However, if the temperature starts off even one one hundredth of a degree above or below this exact value, we see that temperatures eventually converge to one of the other two equilibria. Thus, we call this intermediate equilibrium an unstable equilibrium , because any infinitesimal push away will cause it to careen away towards another state. \" md\"\"\" 2.2 Radiative stability analysis We can understand why our model has two stable equilibria and one unstable equilibrium by applying concepts from dynamical systems theory.

It is also a very good example of the way that Julia libraries are often structured. We will see some basic usage examples and how Julia types are used both to control the library and to store the input and output to the solvers . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Basic usage of DifferentialEquations.jl \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's try to solve the above equation that we derived in the previous lecture, \\dot u p \\, u . We are using u as the name of the dependent variable for consistency with the `DifferentialEquations.jl` documentation and internal structure. We write a general ODE in 1 variable as \\dot u f p t, u . The right hand side of the ODE is given by a function f , which may depend on a parameter p , i.e. a constant which does not change for any given run of the ODE. f may also depend explicitly on time. In our example we do indeed have a parameter p that we want to change, but f does not have an explicit time dependence, so we write \"\"\" f u, p, t p u md\"\"\" Note that you always need the three input arguments `u`, `p` and `t`, in that order, even if you don't use them. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now we define our initial condition u 0 and the time span to integrate over, given as a tuple initial\\ time, final\\ time \"\"\" begin u0 100.0 time span 0.0, 10.0 end md\"\"\" To set up the problem instance we use a type `ODEProblem` that is defined in the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package, into which we pass all the information necessary to define the problem. The parameters must go in the following order \"\"\" md\"\"\" For more advanced use there are also some additional, optional, keyword arguments. Note that the displayed output does not currently include information about the function, nor the parameters. \"\"\" md\"\"\" To solve the ODE we call the `solve` function \"\"\" md\"\"\" What happened here? A suitable solver i.e. an algorithm to calculate the solution was chosen automatically , and it chose certain moments in time at which to output information about the approximate, but very accurate solution. In this particular case it chose to output data at only eight points in time between t 0 and t 10 . Let's try to plot the `solution` object \"\"\" md\"\"\" Plot recipes \"\"\" md\"\"\" Two surprising things happen. Firstly, there is no reason to expect this to have worked `solution` is some kind of Julia object, but somehow `Plots.jl` knows how to plot it. This is because `DifferentialEquations.jl` defines a plot recipe . This specifies a way to turn solution objects into plots Any package can do this relatively easily. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The second surprise is that the output looks like a smooth curve, rather than just 8 points. Let's see those points on top of the curve. We can extract the relevant data from the `solution` object \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that the package in fact gives not only the value at those points, but it is in fact also capable of calculating an approximate solution at any intermediate point, using interpolation . In fact, we can access this by treating `solution` as if it were a function \"\"\" md\"\"\" For this particular ODE we know the analytical solution. Let's compare them as we vary the parameter p \"\"\" md\"\"\" p bind p Slider 0.0 0.1 2.0, show value true \"\"\" problem ODEProblem f, u0, time span, p solution solve problem plot solution, size 500, 300 , label \"solution\" scatter solution.t, solution.u, label \"discrete output\" begin tt 3.5 solution tt end scatter tt , solution tt , label \"t tt \", ms 5, m square let problem ODEProblem f, u0, time span, p solution solve problem plot solution, linewidth 3, xlabel \"t\", yaxis \"x t \", label \"numerical\", size 500, 300 plot t u0 exp p t , lw 3, ls dash, label \"exact\" ylims 0, 100 title \"p p\" end md\"\"\" We see that the numerical and exact solutions are to the eye indistinguishable, and that the package is fast enough to calculate the solution basically in real time. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Systems of ODEs \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's try to solve the SIR equations \\begin aligned \\dot s & \\beta s i \\\\ \\dot i & \\beta s i \\gamma i\\\\ \\dot r & \\gamma i \\end aligned \"\"\" md\"\"\" We need to think of the system in a vector form, \\dot \\mathbf x \\mathbf f \\mathbf p t, \\mathbf x , where the vector \\mathbf x is a vector of all the variables, \\mathbf x x 1, x 2, x 3 s, i, r the function \\mathbf f is a vector valued function \\mathbb R ^3 \\to \\mathbb R ^3 , where f k gives the right hand side of the equation for \\dot x k and the vector \\mathbf p \\beta, \\gamma is a vector of the parameters. \"\"\" x0 0.99, 0.01, 0.0 function SIR x, p, t s, i, r x unpack the vectors into scalar values β, γ p build a new vector to return return β s i, β s i γ i, γ i end md\"\"\" Now we see that the solverr has recognised that everything is a vector, and it returns a vector at each time stamp. Again we can plot \"\"\" md\"\"\" β bind β Slider 0.5 0.01 2.0, default 1.0, show value true γ bind γ Slider 0.5 0.01 2.0, default 0.1, show value true \"\"\" params β, γ SIR problem ODEProblem SIR, x0, 0.0, 50.0 , params sol solve SIR problem plot sol md\"\"\" It knows to plot each variable separately. We can instead plot combinations of variables in phase space or state space \"\"\" plot sol, idxs 1, 2 , xlabel \"s\", ylabel \"i\", arrow true, xlims 0.1, 1.0 , size 500, 300 md\"\"\" And even in 3D \"\"\" let plotly p plot sol, vars 1, 2, 3 , xlabel \"s\", ylabel \"i\", zlabel \"r\" gr p end md\"\"\" The ModelingToolkit.jl https mtk.sciml.ai stable tutorials ode modeling library provides ways to make creating ODE models more intuitive, using symbolic equation objects. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Making objects into callable functions \"\"\" md\"\"\" One of the interesting things we have seen is the way that the `solution` object can be called using the normal syntax for calling functions \"\"\" solution 3.5 md\"\"\" Not all types allow this. For example, if we define a matrix \"\"\" A rand 2, 2 md\"\"\" we cannot usually call it with a vector \"\"\" A rand 2 md\"\"\" If we wanted to do so, we could, however, using the following syntax \"\"\" A Matrix x A x md\"\"\" Note that this makes objects instances of the type callable, rather than the type itself, which we can already call as a constructor to create objects of that type \"\"\" Matrix 1 2 3 4 md\"\"\" For example, if we wanted to write our own type to store the output of the Euler method, we could do something like \"\"\" begin struct SimpleEulerOutput times Vector Float64 values Vector Float64 end function soln SimpleEulerOutput t use interpolation to calculate the value at time t using `soln.times` and `soln.values` end end md\"\"\" The definition of the function makes it callable. This says that \"the way to call an object called `soln`, of type `EulerOutput`, is the following \". Note that inside the function you will need to access the `times` and `values` from inside the `soln` object, using `soln.times` and `soln.values`. Note that at the time of writing, Pluto requires that you put this call definition in the same cell as the type definition. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Digging into objects \"\"\" md\"\"\" A key feature of the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library, and of most other libraries in Julia, is the way they define and use new types . As we have seen previously, we can define new types using `struct` which store data, and then define functions which act on those types. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's start by looking at the `ODEProblem` type \"\"\" problem md\"\"\" To see what fields, or attributes, the object contains we can use \"\"\" fieldnames typeof problem md\"\"\" In Pluto and other interactive environments we can get the same information using `problem. TAB `, i.e. by typing the TAB key after `problem.` \"\"\" md\"\"\" As usual we can extract the data contained in the object as usual using `.` \"\"\" problem.u0 problem.tspan md\"\"\" To see everything contained in the object, we can use `dump` \"\"\" dump problem md\"\"\" This seems much more complicated than you might expect. The library is clearly doing more than just storing the data that we provide in a type The main thing that has happened is that the function we passed in has been processed by wrapping it into yet another type, `ODEFunction`. This contains information such as how to calculate the derivative of the function that can be provided for more advanced usage of the package. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Similarly we can look inside the solution object \"\"\" fieldnames typeof solution dump solution md\"\"\" The solution is even more complicated, containing not only the data that was calculated, but also all information about which algorithms were used to solve the problem and tables of coefficients for interpolation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Parameterized types \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's look now at the type of the DiffEq objects \"\"\" typeof problem md\"\"\" We see that indeed `problem` is an object of type `ODEProblem`, but that it also has several type parameters , which are listed inside the curly braces ` ` and ` ` \"\"\" typeof problem .parameters... md\"\"\" For example, we see that the second type parameter is of type `Tuple Float64, Float64 `, which is the type of the variable `time span` \"\"\" typeof time span md\"\"\" One of the reasons for using parameterized types like this is for efficiency Julia is fastest when it knows the exact types of every variable, since then it can generate efficient machine code. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Making parameterized types \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's see how and why we would make a parameterized type. Let's think again about the `EulerOutput` type that we started to write above. What happens if, as in the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library, we would like to handle both scalar ODEs one single real dependent variable , and vector ODEs? We can no longer specify that the output type is a `Vector Float64 `, so we would need to leave it unspecified \"\"\" struct SimpleEulerOutput2 times values end md\"\"\" However, it turns out that we then lose efficiency speed . What we would need is two different types one in which we specify the type of `values` as `Vector Float64 `, and the other as `Vector Vector Float64 `. Julia provides a mechanism to define both at once this is what parameterized types do \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's define our own `MyODEProblem` type as a simple example. We specify type parameters for each variable \"\"\" struct MyODEProblem T,U t0 T tfinal T u0 U end md\"\"\" Note that the starting and final times have been specified to require the same type `T`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now if we create objects of this type, we see that Julia matches the types we pass in to the correct type parameters \"\"\" newprob MyODEProblem 3, 4, 100.0 newprob.t0 newprob.tfinal newprob.u0 md\"\"\" If we change the types of the inputs, the type parameters change \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3.0, 4.0, 100.0 md\"\"\" If we mix types for the first two arguments then we get an error, since Julia can't match to a single type `T` \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3.0, 5, 100.0 md\"\"\" We can use vectors \"\"\" MyODEProblem 3, 4, 17.0, 18.0 "},{"url":"climate_science/our_first_climate_model/","title":"Our first climate model","tags":["lecture","module3","climate","modeling","track_climate","track_math","plotting","data","ODE","differential equation","CSV","dataframe","track_data"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.25 frontmatter chapter 3 video \"https www.youtube.com watch?v J1UsMa1cTeE\" image \"https user images.githubusercontent.com 6933510 136199705 7bdb6bb0 8698 43a1 87e6 c073ab102da5.png\" section 4 order 4 title \"Our first climate model\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" youtube id \"J1UsMa1cTeE\" description \"\" tags \"lecture\", \"module3\", \"climate\", \"modeling\", \"track climate\", \"track math\", \"plotting\", \"data\", \"ODE\", \"differential equation\", \"CSV\", \"dataframe\", \"track data\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

You can email files to each other This works for small projects, but at some point, you will need something more suited to the task. For example Encyclopedia a wiki system School essay Google Drive Software project GitHub For software projects, people of use GitHub, or similar git based tools to collaborate on their work. Why is that? \"\"\" TableOfContents aside false, depth 1 md\"\"\" Why not Google Drive? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Google Drive or Dropbox, Nextcloud, etc is a platform for realtime collaboration on files. Besides synchronizing single files like the video above , Google Drive also allows you to synchronize entire folders between multiple computers and the cloud. That's awesome So do people use it for collaborative software projects? Well, generally not. Software projects have some unique properties that require different tools. As today's introduction into git , let's look at the differences between a software project and a non software project , and why platforms like Google Drive don't work well for collaborating on code. Note that we will take a different perspective that other introductions to git . Let's start out with a realtime synchronization system like Google Drive as our default, and think about why we might want to change its functionality to make it more suitable for software. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Reason 1 sensitive to change Reason 1 In software projects, small changes often make a big difference. Changes to one file affect the entire program. For example, here is what Pluto.jl looks like after adding a single character to the source code \"\"\" md\"\"\" While a single character can mean disaster, this sensitivity also means that programming languages are quite powerful A small change will often do the trick. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing every change This sensitivity to changes makes realtime synchronization unsuitable for software projects. To see why, let's say that I want to change `sqrt` to `log` in the following code \"\"\" md\"\"\" If you would synchronize every change while making that edit removing the letters `s`, `q`, `r`, `t`, typing `l`, `o`, `g` , then you are publishing broken code to your online code repository. If you were sharing changes in realtime like Google Drive , then other people would get those broken states while working on their features. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing every keystroke \"\"\" md\"\"\" However, if we only publish code manually , we can make sure that we never publish broken code. This means that my collaborators, who might be working on the project at the same time, will not have to deal with errors that are coming from my work in progress changes. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing manually \"\"\" md\"\"\" Even larger chunks In the previous example, we found that we can avoid publishing invalid syntax by not synchronizing on every keystroke like Google Docs, but by synchronizing manually. We also don't want to synchronize the file every time it is saved , because you often try multiple things before finding something that works. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing every save \"\"\" md\"\"\" Synchronizing manually \"\"\" pass2 html\" span style 'opacity .3' ✅ span \" pass \"✅\" | HTML fail \"❌\" | HTML md\"\"\" Reason 2 branches and forks Reason 2 It should be easy to split a project into multiple branches copies of the codebase that can be worked on independently. And after some time, we want to compare branches and merge the new additions into one. Something that you may have done create a copy of your `presentation.ppt` called `presentation with pictures.ppt` before adding your pictures, and if it didn't work, you can go back to yesterday's backup. Now that's great, but what if your teammate also made a copy `presentation with titlepage.ppt` where they also made a change? In this situation, you have created two branches of the same file in parallel, and it will be difficult to combine those changes back into a single `presentation this one really.ppt` file. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Reason 3 automation Reason 3 Git is a platform for automation , and can be a mechanism to automatically test and review changes, release weekly versions, etc etc. Programmers love to automate things, and git allows all sorts of automation. At first, this can be intimidating , and it will take years of experience to learn all the possible tricks. Someone who does 'git magic' as a profession is called a DevOps https en.wikipedia.org wiki DevOps engineer . Don't worry about this too much when getting started with GitHub, and ask others for help if necessary. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Automatic testing While we don't recommend learning about git automation right away, one thing you will probably encounter when contributing to an open source project is automatic testing . More on this later \"\"\" bigbreak html\"\"\" br br br br br br br br \"\"\" bigbreak bigbreak md\"\"\" Our first contribution documentation Today will be a kick start into contributing to open source projects The easiest way to make a great contribution to packages is to contribute a documentation improvement . For our example today, we will look at the package ClimateMARGO.jl https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl , a climate economic model. This package is hosted on GitHub, which means that all code and previous versions of code is available at github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl . The authors also use the same GitHub site to manage their TO DOs — called Issues https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl issues — and to accept contributions from others — called Pull Requests https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl pulls . Today, we are going to make a Pull Request \"\"\" md\"\"\" What is a Pull Request? Julia packages are open source , which means that you are allowed and encouraged to make your own copy of the source code we call this a fork and modify it. If you made some good changes on your fork then you can suggest to changes to the original project by submitting your code as a Pull Request PR . This is a feature built in to GitHub, and this is how most code collaboration happens online. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" After the Pull Request Submitting your Pull Request is a great feeling, but it's not the last step After your submission, the PR will be reviewed by the project authors, and they will leave their feedback. It is common that a PR is not merged accepted directly, but that you are asked to make some small changes. This is possible because a Pull Request is not static — you can make changes to the PR after submitting it Remember that a PR is from one branch to another . You can make changes to your PR simply by adding additional commits to the from branch. \"\"\" md\"\"\" As an example of a Pull Request in the wild, let's look at this PR to `JuliaLang julia` github.com JuliaLang julia pull 40596 https github.com JuliaLang julia pull 40596 . The code change is not so important to us right now, but pay attention to the communication around the code change. \"\"\" md\"\"\" How to use GitHub Enough talk, let's create our first repository \"\"\" md\"\"\" Requirements To follow this introduction, you will need Create an account at github.com github.com . Add a friendly profile picture For Windows & MacOS users, download GitHub Desktop https desktop.github.com , a graphical program to easily manage git repositories on your disk. Linux users can use the slightly more advanced program GitKraken https www.gitkraken.com . A code editor. If you don't have a code editor yet, or if you are using Notepad, gedit or Notepad , we highly recommend VS Code https code.visualstudio.com , an open source, beginner friendly programming environment. It may seem like something new and difficult to learn, but it is easy to use, and because it understands the code that you are writing, it will help you as a beginner programmer. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" ⛑ Git trouble Sooner or later, you will find yourself in git trouble . Unlike Google Drive, it can happen that synchronization requires manual intervention, for example, git might say `🤐 merge conflict` Which means that someone changed a file right before you were going to commit. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fonsi's Git Trouble Fix™ Many git problems have an 'official' solution, and it will take time to learn all of these techniques. In the meantime, here is my fool proof way of solving many tricky git situations \"\"\" md\"\"\" Step 1 Use GitHub Desktop to find out which files you have changed. Are the changes important? Step 2 Take any files that you want to keep, and copy them to a different folder, e.g. your desktop. Step 3 Remove your local clone of the repository, and move any leftover files to the trash. Step 4 Clone the repository again, and copy your files back to their original place, overwriting the cloned files. \"\"\" bigbreak md\"\"\" How to fork and contribute code \"\"\" md\"\"\" Video tutorial will be available here after the live lecture. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Tests People often write tests for their code As part of the codebase, there will be a `test` folder containing scripts that will import the project and run some basic checks. \"\"\" function double x x x end test double 3 6 test double 0 0 md\"\"\" One reason to write tests is to pin specific behaviour, protecting yourself from accidentally changing it later. For example, if you fix a bug that `double 2 ` returns `40` instead of `4`, you would also add a test for `double 2 4`. Months later, when you are changing `double` for another use case, the old test insures that you are not accidentally breaking something that was once fixed. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Running tests You can run the tests of any Julia package by opening the Julia REPL, and typing ```julia julia v1.6 pkg test Example ``` As mentioned before, many project use github magic to automatically run their tests on a server for every change, and you can view the test results online. An important application is running tests for every Pull Request. This means that package authors can quickly review your changes, knowing that it does not break anything. \"\"\" bigbreak md\"\"\" Extra tips \"\"\" md\"\"\" Contributing does not only mean contributing code https opensource.guide how to contribute https opensource.guide how to contribute \"\"\" md\"\"\" Create a \"test\" repository Create multiple \"\"\" md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" function ingredients path String this is from the Julia source code evalfile in base loading.jl but with the modification that it returns the module instead of the last object name Symbol basename path m Module name Core.eval m, Expr toplevel, eval x Expr core, eval name, x , include x Expr top, include name, x , include mapexpr Function, x Expr top, include mapexpr, name, x , include path m end Layout ingredients download \"https raw.githubusercontent.com fonsp disorganised mess 5a59ad7cff1e760b997a54ffa0f8fa202ac16db3 Layout.jl\" stackrows x permutedims hcat x... , 2, 1 flex x Union AbstractVector,Base.Generator kwargs... flex x... kwargs... begin Base. kwdef struct Div contents style Dict end Div x Div contents x function Base.show io IO, m MIME\"text html\", d Div h htl \"\"\" div style d.style d.contents div \"\"\" show io, m, h end end outline x Div x, Dict \"border\" \"3px solid rgba 0,0,0,.3 \", \"border radius\" \"3px\", \"padding\" \"5px\", Div md\"\"\" ```julia function height p c1 sqrt p c2 end ``` \"\"\", md\"to\", md\"\"\" ```julia function height p c1 log p c2 end ``` \"\"\" , Dict \"display\" \"flex\", \"justify content\" \"space evenly\", \"align items\" \"center\", function flex args... kwargs...

https github.com ClimateMARGO ClimateMARGO.jl , a simple climate model, to explore what it takes to avoid the catastrophic impacts of global warming. The code in this webpage is reactive , meaning that the graphs and numbers automatically update whenever you change the climate model's inputs. By Henri F.

For every molecule of CO₂ emitted, about 50% are taken up by plants, soils, or the ocean within a few years, while the rest remains in the atmosphere. The effects of other greenhouse gases, such as Methane and CFCs, and other forcing agents, can approximately be converted into the \"CO₂ equivalent\"– or CO₂ₑ– concentrations that would lead to the same climate forcing . Greenhouse gases get their name because they trap invisible heat radiation emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere from escaping to space, much like greenhouses trap hot air from rising when it is warmed by the Sun. This \"greenhouse effect\" causes the temperature to rise globally, although some places warm more and faster than others. Warmer temperatures exacerbate both the frequency and intensity of \"natural\" disasters, such as heat waves, coastal flooding from major hurricanes, and inland flooding from torrential rain. These climate impacts lead to enhanced climate suffering, which economics typically attempt to quantify suffering in terms of lost money or welfare. In the interactive article below, we invite you to explore the benefits of emissions mitigation and carbon dioxide removal in reducing climate suffering, and the trade offs with their costs. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Mitigating emissions Human greenhouse gas emissions are the result of fossil fuel burning e.g. for transportation, electricity generation, heating, industry , unsustainable agriculture, and land use changes. We refer to any actions or policies that reduce these emissions as mitigation . The MARGO model lumps all potential mitigation into a single number the percentage of baseline emissions that are mitigated in a given year. Baseline emissions are the emissions that would arise in a hypothetical future world absent of climate policy. In our hypothetical no policy world, we assume that emissions will go to zero by 2150 even without climate policy, perhaps because of public health concerns regarding other forms of air pollution, the development of new zero carbon technologies, or running out of extractable fossil fuels resources. In the plot below, drag the blue dot around to vary the amount and timing of mitigation, and observe how these changes affect key climate variables, using the drop box menu CO₂ₑ emissions, CO₂ₑ concentrations, and global temperature. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Cost & damages \"\"\" bind cost benefits narrative slide Carousel md\"\"\" 1. The costs of climate suffering In the absence of climate action, temperatures would rise over 4.5ºC above preindustrial levels 1800 to 1850 average , causing catastrophic climate impacts. MARGO attempts to quantify this suffering by translating the degree of warming into economic damages in \\ year . The curve below shows how climate damages rise over time, as a percentage of the World Gross Domestic Product WGDP in that year, due to uncontrolled temperature increases. \"\"\", md\"\"\" 2. Avoiding climate damages Emissions mitigation limits future warming and climate suffering Damages curve . The economic benefits of mitigation are given by the difference in damages relative to the no policy scenario Baseline curve minus Damages curve . In the figure below, drag around the blue dot to change the future mitigation strategy, and observe how the Avoided damages the grey area change \"\"\", md\"\"\" 3. Cost benefit analysis Unfortunately, mitigating CO₂ₑ emissions also carries a cost. In MARGO, the marginal cost of mitigation is proportional to the fraction of CO₂ₑ emissions that have been mitigated in a given year, increasing up to a maximum of 70 per metric ton of CO₂ₑ at 100% mitigation. This naturally leads to a cost benefit analysis . We search for the most beneficial, or optimal , scenario the one with the maximum net present benefits . In the figure below, try finding a mitigation strategy that optimizes these Net benefits . \"\"\" wraparound false if cost benefits narrative slide 1 hidecloack \"cost benefits narrative input\" end md\"\"\" Picking up the slack carbon dioxide removal While substantial emissions mitigations are necessary to reduce future climate suffering, they can not make up for the hundreds of billions of tons of CO₂ that humans have already emitted. However, both natural and technological methods for removing CO₂ from the atmosphere exist. Although they are presently miniscule compared to the tens of gigatons scale of global emissions, experts expect that they will play a key role in the future. In MARGO, we do not distinguish between different carbon dioxide removal methods, and further assume that the carbon is stored permanently. Drag the yellow dot in the figure below to modify the amount and timing of carbon dioxide removal . \"\"\" md\"\"\" MARGO's automated optimization In the above example, you manually adjusted the timing and amount of mitigation and carbon dioxide removal, but did not have much control on the shape of curves. Using a computer algorithm, we can do this optimization step automatically and faster , without having to assume anything about the shape of the mitigation and carbon dioxide removal curves. \"\"\" blob md\"\"\" Maximum temperature `0.0 °C` Tmax 9 slider `5.0 °C` Allow temperature overshoot allow overshoot 9 cb \"\"\", \" c5710014\" md\"\"\" Appendix This interactive page is a Pluto notebook https github.com fonsp Pluto.jl , which means that it contains its own source code, and we encourage you to take a look behind the scenes.

We should be able to predict that using observations about the current state of the atmosphere and mathematical models in the form of partial differential equations that predict how the wind will move the air around, what the temperature will be, and how much water can precipitate out. What about predicting rain next week? Next year? We know from experience that we can only predict the weather in the short term, up to a week or so and still only with a certain probability . Predicting even one month out doesn't seem possible. On the other hand, we can talk about the climate and how it behaves on much longer time scales, e.g. \"the average temperature in in Boston in April is 55°F\". The short term weather has a significant random or apparently random component, but becomes much more predictable when we look at statistical properties like averages and standard deviations this is then called climate . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Nonlinear dynamics stability and bifurcations \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this notebook we will see that the simplest possible model of the weather, a set of 3 coupled, nonlinear ODEs known as the Lorenz equations , can have unpredictable behaviour, known as deterministic chaos . We will build up to that by looking at two simpler models of dynamics, in 1D and 2D. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Reminder Ordinary Differential Equations ODEs \"\"\" md\"\"\" Recall that we are looking at differential equations , with the goal of modelling the evolution in time of the climate. The simplest such models are ordinary differential equations ODEs , where one or a few continuous variables evolve continuously in time, with a model that specifies their instantaneous rate of change as a function of their current values. The general form of an ODE that does not depend explicitly on time, i.e. that is autonomous , is \\frac dx t dt f x t , or \\dot x t f x t , with an initial condition x t 0 x 0 . Here \\dot x t denotes the derivative of the function t \\mapsto x t at time t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We have seen that the simplest numerical method to solve such an equation is the forward Euler method , in which we convert this equation into an explicit time stepping routine we take a small time step of length h and approximate the derivative as \\frac dx t dt \\simeq \\frac x t h x t h , giving the numerical method x n 1 x n h f x n , where x n is the approximation of the true solution x t n at the n th time step t n . \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1D Modelling bacterial growth \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's use this to simulate a simple nonlinear ODE describing the dynamics of a population of bacteria. The bacteria reproduce at a rate \\lambda provided that there is sufficient food, in which case we would have \\dot x \\lambda x . But the need for enough food will put a limit on the sustainable population to a value K , sometimes called the carrying capacity . The simplest model for the combined effect of growth and saturation is as follows \\dot x \\lambda \\, x \\, K x . When x is close to 0 , the growth rate is \\lambda , but that rate decreases as x increases. This is sometimes called the logistic https en.wikipedia.org wiki Logistic function Logistic differential equation differential equation, although that name does not seem particularly helpful. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Our goal is to use computational thinking, but we will actually not be interested so much in the exact dynamics in time, but rather in the qualitative features of the behaviour of the system. For example, at long times formally t \\to \\infty does the population get arbitrarily large? Or does it, for example, oscillate around a particular value? Or does it converge to a particular size? This forms the subject of nonlinear dynamics or dynamical systems theory. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's simulate the system using the Euler method to try to guess the answer to this question. Note that there are many much more sophisticated methods for solving ODEs collected in the DifferentialEquations.jl package. We should never use the Euler method in practice, but should use a tried and tested library instead, and algorithms that provide much better accuracy in the solutions, if we are interested in faithful numerical results. \"\"\" md\"\"\" It's useful to rescale the variables to the simplest form \\dot x x \\, 1 x . We can do so by defining new adimensional space and time variables x' and t' as follows x K \\, x' , giving K \\dot x' \\lambda K \\, x' K K x' , and then t' \\lambda K \\, t , giving dx' dt' x' 1 x' . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We define a function representing the right hand side of the ODE \"\"\" logistic x x 1 x md\"\"\" Let's simulate this with the Euler method and plot the trajectory x t as a function of time t \"\"\" md\"\"\" Normally we would not choose the Euler method to calculate actual trajectories, but it is enough for our purposes of understanding the qualitative behaviour of the equations. \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that for this particular initial condition, the solution seems to settle down to a fixed value after some time, and then remains at that value thereafter. Such a value is called a fixed point , a stationary point , or a steady state of the ODE. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Qualitative behaviour Fixed points and their stability \"\"\" gr fmt png, dpi 150, size 300, 200 gr fmt svg gr fmt png, dpi 300, size 400, 300 md\"\"\" Let's see what happens for other initial conditions \"\"\" md\"\"\" x₀ bind x0 Slider 0.9 0.001 3.0, default 0.5, show value true \"\"\" md\"\"\" To get an overview of the behaviour we can draw all the results on a single graph \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that all the curves starting near to x 0 1.0 seem to converge to 1 at long times. If the system starts exactly at 0 then it stays there forever. However, if it starts close to 0, on either side, then it moves away from 0 on that same side of 0 starting from a negative value x becomes ever more negative. Even though negative populations have no meaning in the original interpretation as the dynamics of a population, we can still ask study the dynamics of the equation with negative initial conditions, since it may model other systems too. The special values x^ 1 1 and x^ 2 0 are called stationary points or fixed points of the differential equation. If we start at x^ i , then the derivative there is f' x^ i 0 , and hence we cannot move away from x^ i The fixed points can be found as zeros or roots of the function f , i.e. values x^ such that f x^ 0 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see, though, that the two types of fixed points are qualitatively different trajectories that start close to x^ 1 1 move towards x^ 1 , whereas trajectories that start close to x^ 2 0 move away from it. We say that x^ 1 is a stable fixed point and x^ 2 is an unstable fixed point . In general it is not possible to find analytical formulas for the position and stability of fixed points instead, we can use numerical root finding algorithms , for example the Newton method. There are various Julia packages with implementations of these algorithms we will use `Roots.jl`, which works well for scalar valued functions. \"\"\" md\"\"\" State space Vector field and phase portrait \"\"\" md\"\"\" If we want to find the whole trajectory for a given initial condition then we need to solve the equations, either numerically or analytically. However, we may want less information about the system, for example the long time or asymptotic dynamics. It turns out that we can obtain some information about that without explicitly solving the ODE This is the qualitative approach to studying nonlinear systems. Instead of drawing trajectories x t as a function of time t , as we did above, let's use a different graphical representation, where we draw state space or phase space This is the set \"space\" of all possible values of the dependent variables \"states\" . For the above ODE there is only a single dependent variable, x , so the state space is the real line, \\mathbb R . At each possible value of x , the ODE gives us information about the rate of change of x t at that point. Let's draw an arrow at that point, pointing in the direction that a particle placed at that point would move to the right if \\dot x 0 and to the left if \\dot x 0 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" This vector field indeed gives us a qualitative picture of the dynamics. It does not tell us how fast the dynamics will occur in each region, but it indicates what the tendency is. We have coded the fixed points according to their stability this may be calculated using the derivative evaluated at the fixed point, f' x^ , since this derivative controls the behaviour of nearby initial conditions x^ \\delta x . The unstable fixed point is shown as a green square, and the stable fixed point as a grey circle we will use this convention throughout the notebook. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Bifurcations \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now suppose that there is a parameter \\mu in the system that can be varied. For each value of \\mu we have a different ODE \\dot x f \\mu x . For example, \\dot x \\mu x^2. Let's draw the state space for each different value of \\mu \"\"\" g μ, x μ x^2 md\"\"\" μ bind λ Slider 1.0 0.05 1, show value true \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's collect all the vector fields into a single plot. The horizontal axis now represents the different possible values of the parameter \\mu \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that at the critical value \\mu c 0 there is a qualitative change in behaviour of the system for \\mu c 0 there are two fixed points, whereas for \\mu c 0 there are no fixed points at all. Such a qualitative change is called a bifurcation . In this particular case the two fixed points collide in a saddle node or fold bifurcation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1D Bistability and hysteresis \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now let's look at the dynamics of the following system \\dot x \\mu x x^3. \"\"\" h μ, x μ x x^3 md\"\"\" Let's plot the bifurcation diagram again \"\"\" md\"\"\" We see that there is a range of values of \\mu for which there are three coexisting fixed points , two stable and one unstable. Since there are two stable fixed points in which the system can remain, we say that the system is bistable . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now that we understand what the plots mean and the dynamics, let's plot just the fixed points x^ \\mu as a function of \\mu . Such a plot is called a bifurcation diagram \"\"\" md\"\"\" The pieces of curve are called branches . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Hysteresis \"\"\" md\"\"\" Suppose we now think about slowly varying the parameter \\mu . If we change the parameter \\mu by a little, the system is no longer at a fixed point, since the position of the fixed point moves when \\mu changes. However, the system will then relax it will follow the dynamics at the new value of \\mu , and will rapidly converge to the new fixed point nearby for that new value of \\mu . For example, starting at \\mu 2 , the system will stay on the lower black stable branch until \\mu 0.4 or so. At that point, two fixed points collide and annihilate each other After that there is no longer a fixed point nearby. However, there is another fixed point much further up that will now attract all trajectories, so the system rapidly transitions to that fixed point. Now suppose we decrease the parameter again. The system will now track the upper branch until \\mu 0.4 or so, when again it will jump back down. For each parameter value \\mu in the interval 0.4, 0.4 there is bistability , i.e. coexistence of two fixed points with the same value of \\mu together with a third, unstable fixed point that is not observable . The fact that the system tracks different stable branches depending on where we started, i.e. on the history of the dynamics, is known as hysteresis . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Hysteretic behaviour like this is found in many scientific and engineering contexts, including switches in biology, for example genetic switches, and in the historical dynamics of the earth's climate. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Slow fast systems \"\"\" md\"\"\" What are we actually doing when we let the parameter \\mu vary? Effectively we now have a system of two coupled ODEs, for example \\dot x \\mu x x^3 \\dot \\mu \\epsilon, where \\mu varies at a slow speed \\epsilon . On a time scale much shorter than 1 \\epsilon , the dynamics of x \"does not know\" that \\mu is changing, so it will converge to a fixed point x^ \\mu for the current value of \\mu . An associated term is adiabatic approximation . However, in fact \\mu does gradually change, so the value of x will effectively \"slide along\" the curve x t \\simeq x^ \\mu t , tracking the curve of fixed points as \\mu changes. Once \\mu reaches a critical value \\mu c , however, there is no longer a nearby fixed point to move to, and the vector field will move the system to rapidly transition to the far away alternative fixed point. If we now reverse the dynamics of \\mu , we slide back along the upper branch. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 2D Oscillations in chemical reactions the Brusselator model \"\"\" md\"\"\" Bifurcations are not restricted to 1D systems indeed, the dynamics can be much richer in higher dimensions.

We actually derived this global, or macroscopic, model from a microscopic stochastic model a few lectures ago. Components can fail at any moment but we'll start off by checking once per day to count the number that have failed during that day. Then we'll check several times per day. This is still a discrete model. Finally we'll see how we can turn this into a continuous model where we can talk about the number that have failed by any real time t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Checking failures once per day integer time steps \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call N k the average number of bulbs that are still functioning on day number k , starting from an initial number N 0 . We can find an equation for the number N k 1 that are still functioning at the end of day number k 1 by working out how many fail on day k 1 . Let's call p the probability that each bulb fails each day. For example, if 10% of the bulbs fail each day then p 0.1 . If there are 100 bulbs and 10% fail on the first day, then 10 fail, so there will be 90 remaining. In general, if a proportion p of the N k fail, in total we expect p \\, N k to fail. Hence N k 1 N k p \\, N k or N k 1 N k p N k. In this very simple model we can actually solve this recurrence relation analytically to find the number still functioning at time t N k 1 1 p N k so N k 1 p N k 1 1 p ^2 N k 2 \\cdots hence N k N 0 \\, 1 p ^k. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Checking failures n times per day \"\"\" md\"\"\" Now suppose instead we ask how many light bulbs fail in half a day. If 10% fail per day, it's natural to think that 5% fail in half a day. However, this is not quite right due to the effect of compounding as in compound interest . If 5% fail and then 5% of the remainder fail, then how many are left? \"\"\" 1 0.05 1 0.05 md\"\"\" So slightly fewer than 10% in total have failed, due to the effect of compounding. Nonetheless, the result is approximately right, so let's take that. \"\"\" md\"\"\" So let's suppose that n times a day, a proportion p n fail for example, 10% and twice a day gives 5% failing each time, approximately . Then the number remaining after the first failure check on day k is \"\"\" md\"\"\" N k \\frac 1 n \\textstyle 1 \\frac p n N k Here we have used a subscript since we are in a discrete situation. We could also have written instead N k \\textstyle \\frac 1 n . The solution at the next day is N k 1 N k \\, 1 \\textstyle \\frac p n ^n.

It thus makes sense to define a limiting object , which is what would happen if you could take smaller and smaller time steps in the right way, i.e. take the limit as n \\to \\infty . In that case we could imagine being able to calculate the average number N t of bulbs that are functioning at time t , where t can be any positive real number. \"\"\" md\"\"\" In calculus we learn ways to see that \"\"\" md\"\"\" 1 p n ^n converges to \\exp p as n \\to \\infty . \"\"\" md\"\"\" An alternative approach is to look at the time evolution in terms of differences . In a time 1 n a proportion p n decays. Here we are thinking of \\delta t 1 n as the time step between consecutive checks. If there are N t bulbs functioning at a time t and we take a small time step of general length \\delta t , a proportion p \\, \\delta t should fail, so that \"\"\" md\"\"\" N t \\delta t N t p \\, \\delta t \\, N t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Dividing through by \\delta t we find \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac N t \\delta t N t \\delta t p \\, N t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" We now recognise the left hand side of the equation if we take the limit as \\delta t \\to 0 , we have exactly the definition of the derivative \\frac dN t dt . Hence, taking that limit we obtain \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\frac dN t dt p \\, N t with N 0 N 0 , the initial number. This is an ordinary differential equation it is an equation relating the value of the function N t at time t to the derivative slope of that function at that point. This relationship must hold for all t . It is not obvious that this equation even makes sense although it should do, given the way we have derived it , but in differential equations courses we see that it does make sense under some technical conditions , and uniquely specifies a function satisfying the ODE together with the initial condition. This is called an \"initial value problem\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" In this particular case, once again we are lucky enough to be able to solve this equation analytically N t is a function whose derivative is a multiple of the same function, and hence it must be exponential \"\"\" md\"\"\" N t N 0 \\exp p \\, t \"\"\" md\"\"\" This is an alternative way to define the exponential function.

You are surely familiar with models of this type modelling the spread of COVID 19, and from the homework. As in the homework, we can make a fully discrete, stochastic agent based model, where we give microscopic rules specifying how individual agents interact with one another. When we run such models with large enough systems, we observe that the results are often quite smooth. An alternative approach is to try to write down macroscopic discrete equations that describe the dynamics of averages. Often it is easier to understand the behaviour of such systems by formulating a continuous version of the model. Some people make discrete models because they're not happy with continuous models large discrete models can also be computationally wasteful. On the other hand, they can also include effects that might be more difficult to model in a continuous framework, e.g. non local effects or things that \"don't become continuous very well\". \"\"\" md\"\"\" Discrete time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" First let's think about the SI model agents can be susceptible S and infectious I . A susceptible person becomes infectious when they come into contact with an infectious person, with some probability. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Let's call S t and I t be the number of susceptible and infectious people at time t , respectively, and let's call N the total number of people. Let's suppose that at each time step, each infectious person has the chance to interact with one other person on average . That person will be chosen at random from the total population of size N . A new infection occurs only if that chosen person is susceptible, which happens with probability S t N , and only if the infection attempt is successful, with probability b , say. Hence the change in the number of infectious people after that step is \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\Delta I t I t 1 I t b \\, I t \\, \\left \\frac S t N \\right \"\"\" md\"\"\" The decrease in S t is also given by \\Delta I t . \"\"\" md\"\"\" There is also recovery, with a constant probability c at each step, once you are infectious. It is useful to normalize by N , so we define the proportions of the population that are susceptible, infectious and recovered as s t \\frac S t N \\quad i t \\frac I t N \\quad r t \\frac R t N . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Including recovery with probability c we obtain the discrete time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\begin align s t 1 & s t b \\, s t \\, i t \\\\ i t 1 & i t b \\, s t \\, i t c \\, i t\\\\ r t 1 & r t c \\, i t \\end align \"\"\" md\"\"\" Continuous time SIR model \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can now go through the same process as with the failure model, where we take time steps of length \\delta t instead, and replace probabilities b and c with rates \\beta and \\gamma . Taking the limit \\delta t \\to 0 we get \"\"\" md\"\"\" \\begin align \\frac ds t dt & \\beta \\, s t \\, i t \\\\ \\frac di t dt & \\beta \\, s t \\, i t & \\gamma \\, i t \\\\ \\frac dr t dt & & \\gamma \\, i t \\end align \"\"\" md\"\"\" We can think of this as a model of a chemical reaction with species S, I and R. The term s t i t is known as the mass action https en.wikipedia.org wiki Law of mass action form of interaction. Note that no analytical solutions of these simple nonlinear ODEs are known as a function of time However, parametric solutions are known https arxiv.org abs 1403.2160 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Below is an example simulation of the discrete time model. \"\"\" begin NN 100 SS NN 1 II 1 RR 0 end ss, ii, rr SS NN, II NN, RR NN p infection, p recovery 0.1, 0.01 TT 1000 function discrete SIR s0, i0, r0, T 1000 s, i, r s0, i0, r0 results s s, i i, r r for t in 1 T Δi p infection s i Δr p recovery i s new s Δi i new i Δi Δr r new r Δr push results, s s new, i i new, r r new s, i, r s new, i new, r new end return results end SIR discrete SIR ss, ii, rr begin ts 1 length SIR discrete time SIR plot plot ts, x.s for x in SIR , m o, label \"S\", alpha 0.2, linecolor blue, leg right, size 400, 300 plot ts, x.i for x in SIR , m o, label \"I\", alpha 0.2 plot ts, x.r for x in SIR , m o, label \"R\", alpha 0.2 xlims 0, 500 end md\"\"\" Time stepping The Euler method \"\"\" md\"\"\" Above we showed how we can think of Ordinary Differential Equations ODEs as arising in a natural way from discrete time models where we take time steps. What about if somebody gives us an ODE how should we solve it numerically? In fact, we do the reverse process We discretize the equation and reduce it to a system where we take time steps Suppose the differential equation is \\dot x f x The simplest such method is the Euler method we approximate the derivative using a small but not too small time step h what we called \\delta t above \\dot x \\simeq \\frac x t h x t h giving x t \\delta t \\simeq x t h \\, f x . The Euler method with constant time step is then the following algorithm x k 1 x k h \\, f x k If we have several variables in our ODE, we can wrap the variables up into a vector and use the same method for the ODE \\dot \\mathbf x \\mathbf f \\mathbf x the Euler method becomes \\mathbf x k 1 \\mathbf x k h \\, \\mathbf f \\mathbf x k , where \\mathbf f denotes is a vector valued function mapping the vector of variables to the vector of right hand sides of the ODEs. \"\"\" md\"\"\" However, in general the Euler method is not a good algorithm to simulate the dynamics of an ODE We can see why that might be from the graphs at the start of this notebook taking time steps like this actually does a bad job at approximating the continuous curve. Numerical analysis courses show how to design better numerical methods to approximate the true solution of an ODE more accurately. The Julia SciML DifferentialEquations.jl https diffeq.sciml.ai stable tutorials ode example ecosystem provides a large suite of methods for solving ODEs and many other types of differential equations using state of the art methods. \"\"\" "},{"url":"homework/hw1/","title":"sample homework","tags":["module2","track_julia","track_material","homeworks","pluto","PlutoTeachingTools"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.25 frontmatter homework number \"1\" order \"2.5\" title \"sample homework\" tags \"module2\", \"track julia\", \"track material\", \"homeworks\", \"pluto\", \"PlutoTeachingTools\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" description \"sample howework\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils using PlutoTeachingTools, PlutoUI md\"\"\" Sample Homework This notebook showcases some of the features of `PlutoTeachingTools.jl` https github.com JuliaPluto PlutoTeachingTools.jl and how to use these to write homework assignment in Pluto. \"\"\" tip md\"\"\"For a deeper tour of `PlutoTeachingTools.jl`, check their documentation https juliapluto.github.io PlutoTeachingTools.jl example.html \"\"\" md\"\"\" Useful functionalities `PlutoTeachingTools.jl` has some functions like `correct`, `still missing`, here a few demoes \"\"\" correct still missing keep working keep working md\"you can also give custom text to the boxes\" hint md\"this is a hint, hover the box to unblur the text\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 a simple exercise Replace missing with the value `1`. \"\"\" x missing if ismissing x still missing elseif x 1 && x isa Int correct elseif x 1 && x isa Int b1 almost md\"\"\"Your variable has the right value, but it's not quite the right answer.

Each cell should contain 1 julia expression function definition, if statement, variable assignment, etc. . ```julia if rand 0.5 \"hi\" else \"there\" end ``` or ```julia a 1 ``` or ```julia function f return rand ^ 2 end ``` However , multiple expressions in the same cell are not allowed, for example ```julia a 1 b 2 a b ``` cannot be written in the same cell. You have two alternatives 1. Split it into multiple cells recommended to make reactivity better . 2. Wrap your staments inside a `begin ... end` or `let ... end` block. The difference is that the latter introduces a local scope, hence variables defined inside `let` are not visibles from outside. Reactivity Pluto is reactive This means that if you define a variable `a` in a cell, when you edit the variable value, all cells depending on that variable are automatically re evaluated. A few notes 1. As mentioned above, better to have a single variable assignment per cell, this will make the dependency graph slimmer and reactivity smoother. 2. Code modifying a given variable should be in the same cell, i.e. you cannot have two cells modifying the same variable.

You then use that inside an HTML block ``` html\\\"\\\"\\\" ~ paste embed code here ~ \\\"\\\"\\\" ``` You might need to change the `width` to `100%` to make it fit.\" html\"\"\" div style \"padding 56.25% 0 0 0 position relative \" iframe src \"https player.vimeo.com video 438210156\" style \"position absolute top 0 left 0 width 100% height 100% \" frameborder \"0\" allow \"autoplay fullscreen\" allowfullscreen iframe div script src \"https player.vimeo.com api player.js\" script \"\"\" md\" LocalResource not recommended The examples above use `Resource` to make media from a URL available inside Markdown. To use local files , simply replace `Resource` with `LocalResource` , and use a file path instead of a URL.\" html\" span style 'font family cursive color purple ' I really hope that this works span \" md\"\"\"Hello I am a dog LocalResource \"C \\\\Users\\\\fons\\\\Pictures\\\\hannes.jpg\" \"\"\" md\"\"\" html\" span style 'font family cursive color purple ' OOPS span \" , it didn't html\" br \" Here are two tips for getting local images to work correctly 1. Go to imgur.com https imgur.com and drag&drop the image to the page. Right click on the image, and select \"Copy image location\". You can now use the image like so ```PlutoUI.Resource \"https i.imgur.com SAzsMMA.jpg\" ``` 2. If your notebook is part of a git repository, place the image in the repository and use a relative path ```PlutoUI.LocalResource \".. images cat.jpg\" ``` \"\"\" md\" Why does it have to be so difficult? Pluto only stores code in the notebook file, not images. This minimal file format is very valuable, but it means that images need to be addressed , not stored. Addressing local files is fragile if someone else opens the notebook, or if you move the notebook to a different folder, that image file needs to be available at exactly the same path. This is difficult to do correctly, and if it works for you, it is hard to tell if it will work for someone else. Putting images online might be a hassle, but once it works, it will work everywhere The stateless nature of URLs means that the images will work regardless of how the notebook file is accessed, while keeping a minimal file format.\" md\" PlutoUI without Pluto Huh? Did you know that you can run Pluto notebooks without Pluto ? If your notebook is called `wow.jl`, then ```sh julia wow.jl ``` will run the notebook just fine. When you use ` bind`, your notebook can still run without Pluto Sort of. Normally, all bound variables are assigned the value `missing` when you run it elsewhere. However, the `PlutoUI` types have all been configured to assign a more sensible default value. For example, if your notebook contains ```julia bind x Slider 10 20 ``` and you run it without Pluto, then this statement simply assigns `x 10`. \" md\"`Pluto` and `PlutoUI` work independently of each other In fact, you could write a package with fun input elements, or add ` bind`able values to existing packages.\" md\" Appendix\" space html\" br br br \" space space space space space "},{"url":"mod3_publish_website/deploy_static/","title":"Deploy your website as static","tags":["module3","track_setup","deploy","netlify","github actions","github pages"],"text":"Deploying with github pages Deploying your website as static page with github pages is a breeze.
